            I am an abstract expressionist artist who transforms emotions into
            digital art. Through bold strokes and dynamic colors on my tablet, I
            create pieces that speak to the raw, authentic experiences of being
            human. My work is deeply personal yet universally relatable â€“ each
            digital artwork a conversation between spontaneity and intention.
